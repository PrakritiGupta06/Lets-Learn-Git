      <b>Coronaviruses</b> are a group of related
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthornavirae">RNA viruses</a> that
      cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause
      respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to <sup><a href="link.com">[2]</a></sup> Mild
      illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also
      caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal
      varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause
      diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily <b>Orthocoronavirinae</b>, in the
      family Coronaviridae,order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are
      enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a
      nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges
      from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA
      viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from
      their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent
      of the solar corona, from which their name derives.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
      </li>
      <p>
        The name "coronavirus" is derived from Latin corona, meaning "crown" or
        "wreath", itself a borrowing from Greek κορώνη korṓnē, "garland,
        wreath".<sup>[9][10]</sup> The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell
        who first observed and studied human coronaviruses. The word was first
        used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal
        Nature to designate the new family of viruses.[8] The name refers to the
        characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus)
        by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface
        projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo.
        This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are
        proteins on the surface of the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scientific name Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by the
        International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (later renamed
        International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) in 1971.[13] As the
        number of new species increased, the genus was split into four genera,
        namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and
        Gammacoronavirus in 2009. [14] The common name coronavirus is used to
        refer to any member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. As of 2020, 45
        species are officially recognised.

    <p>
      Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
Admit impediments; love is not love<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove:<br>
O, no, it is an ever-fixèd mark,<br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
It is the star to every wand’ring bark,<br>
Whose worth’s unknown, although his heighth be taken.<br>
Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
Within his bending sickle’s compass come;<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
If this be error and upon me proved,<br>
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<br>
